# A theoretical and empirical comparative analysis of Single-Source Shortest-Paths Algorithms
This is a publicly available repository containing the contents of the project, for the HU course, CS412: Algorithms Design and Analysis. Within this repository, one shall file the following:
- All implementations for the tested approaches (i.e., Bellman-Ford; Array-based Dijkstra and Binary-Heap based Dijkstra)
- All empirical timing-based results for all three classes of inputs (i.e., dense, average and sparse)
- All relevant documentation pertinent to the project - (i) a report detailing the experiments and results (ii) a poster for the project (iii) a presentation that distills the report

**Note**: What is missing from this project are the random inputs generated via the Erdos-Reyni model - generated via the NetworkX library all the random grapghs were saved in separate text files in a weighted edge list representation. The total size of the generated dataset prevents dissemination at this time.
